# gulp

## What you can do
With gulp you can:
- Compile the SCSS file into a CSS file, add a vendor prefix, compress it, and output it. 
- Compress and output the JavaScript file.
- Convert the string __NOCACHE__ to UNIX timestamp string.
The reason for doing this is to avoid caching of images and so on.
As a premise, you need to include the string __NOCACHE__ in the html file.
